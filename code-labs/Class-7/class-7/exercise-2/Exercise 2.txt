From my understanding this assignment is that even though the variable hello was
defined after the anonymous function it can still be used by the function because before
the anonymous function executed the hello variable was already defined in the scope.
function sayHi(){
    let say = function(){
        console.log(hello);
    }

    let hello = "Hello world!";
    return say;
}

let sayHiClosure = sayHi();
sayHiClosure();
