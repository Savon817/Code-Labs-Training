For this exercise we are trying to understand closures.
For example here is the code:
function numGenerator() {
    
    let num = 10;
    function checkNumber(){
        console.log(num);
    }
    num++
    return checkNumber;
}

let number = numGenerator();
number();

By the end we want to know what will number() output to the console.
My answer is that it'll output a number and that number is 11
